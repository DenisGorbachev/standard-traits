# A collection of standard traits for better interoperability between crates

[![Build](https://github.com/DenisGorbachev/standard-traits/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DenisGorbachev/standard-traits)
[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/standard-traits/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/standard-traits)

Standard Traits improve the interoperability between crates by defining a set of common functionality.

For example, both [`std::collections::HashMap`][__link0] and [`indexmap_2::IndexMap`][__link1] have an `insert` method. However, we can’t write a function that accepts both types, since there is no `Insert` trait. This crate provides

This crate provides implementations for types in `std`. In addition, it provides implementations for existing popular crates (for example: `indexmap`, `camino`).

If you would like to implement the standard traits for your own types, please add `standard-traits` as a dependency and put the implementations in your crate (next to the types).

### Recommendations for trait definitions

* Parametrize every type
  * Parametrize input type via trait parameter
  * Parametrize output type via associated type
* Provide the Self type as a default value for the every trait parameter

Good example:

```rust
pub trait Join<Rhs = Self> {
    type Output;

    fn join(self, rhs: Rhs) -> Self::Output;
}
```

Bad example 1:

```rust
pub trait Join {
    type Output;

    fn join(self, str: &str) -> Self::Output;
}
```

The trait definition is too narrow: the `join` function only accepts an `&str` as a second argument.

Bad example 2:

```rust
pub trait Join<Rhs = Self> {
    fn join(self, rhs: Rhs) -> Self;
}
```

Suppose there is a type that can’t implement `join` for any `rhs`, but it can implement for some `rhs`. In other words, `join` must return a `Result`. But this trait definition makes it impossible.
